# Cardio

### Features
- This is a straightforward, attractive, and user-friendly Android application for monitoring blood pressure and heart rate data.

- It is important to keep track of one's blood pressure and heart rate data as it reflects one's health situation. To simplify this for users, we have developed an app to monitor their blood pressure and heart rate data. An indicator flag is used based on the blood pressure and heart rate readings to help users take good care of their health.

- In this application, We've used the Firebase Realtime Database to store and sync data in real-time. Firebase Authentication is used to manage user authentication and access control in the app. When adding a new entry, the system captures the time and date for the corresponding entry from the device's system clock.
